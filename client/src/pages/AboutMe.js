      <p>
        My hobbies include dying a lot in bloodborne and watching cooking and
        coding videos on youtube.Sometimes when im feeling spry I leave my
        apartment and go climbing or walk to the grocery store to grab some
        cupcakes and seltzer.I grew up in Oneonta Ny which is a decrepit
        railroad town with 3 different pits for the disposal of roadkill.I was
        in the grocery business for 10 year before beginning this new carreer in
        becoming a software engineer.
